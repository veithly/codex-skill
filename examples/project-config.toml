Project: Example TypeScript Application

Code Standards:
- Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Follow the existing patterns in src/components/
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Write unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library

File Structure:
- Components go in src/components/
- API routes go in src/api/
- Utilities go in src/utils/
- Types go in src/types/

Conventions:
- Use named exports, not default exports
- Use async/await, not callbacks or .then()
- Use const by default, let only when needed
- Add JSDoc comments for exported functions
